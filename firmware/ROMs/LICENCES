These are what I believe are free-to-distribute ROM images.

The 48_original ROM is the original 48K ROM from the ZX Spectrum.
This is copyright Amstrad, free to distribute for non-profit.

The 48_pico ROM is the original 48K ROM with the banner messgae
changed. This allows the user to see that the ZX Spectrum's ROM
isn't the one running. This is the default ROM image for my
Pico based ROM device.

The Retroleum ROM is the diagnostics ROM image as provided by
Retroleum in their trouble shooting ROM cards.

The GOSH wonderful ROM is Geoff Wearmouth's ROM as presented
