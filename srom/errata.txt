The footprint for the SN74LVC245ANSR is wrong. The data sheet says 

SOIC (20) 12.80 mm × 7.50 mm

so I used the SOIC-20W_7.5x12.8mm_P1.27mm one. But there's a
discrepancy; the footprint is 7.5mm across the body of the device,
the datasheet says that distance is across the pins. The body of
the device is 5.00mm to 5.6mm according to the datasheet (which
it is). There isn't a non-wide version of that footprint in the
KiCAD libs. The one to use appears to be the SO-20_5.3x12.6mm_P1.27mm
one.


The footprint for the Pico's schottky diode is wrong. I copied AM's
circuit where he's used a SOD323 footprint. The diodes I bought are
3216 sized, and so too big.


A switch to disable /ROMCS would be useful, so I can switch the
Spectrum's ROM back in and check I've not wrecked it.
