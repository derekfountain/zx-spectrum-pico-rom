The footprint for the SN74LVC245ANSR is wrong. The data sheet says 

SOIC (20) 12.80 mm × 7.50 mm

so I used the SOIC-20W_7.5x12.8mm_P1.27mm one. But there's a
discrepancy; the footprint is 7.5mm across the body of the device,
the datasheet says that distance is across the pins. The body of
the device is 5.00mm to 5.6mm according to the datasheet (which
it is). There isn't a non-wide version of that footprint in the
KiCAD libs. The one to use appears to be the SO-20_5.3x12.6mm_P1.27mm
one.


The footprint for the Pico's schottky diode is wrong. I copied AM's
circuit where he's used a SOD323 footprint. The diodes I bought are
3216 sized, and so too big. Increase footprint size.


I don't need the /WR line at the Pico. The level shifter for the
data bus is permanently in the Pico->ZX direction, so I can't
pick up a written value from the data bus. That level shifter is
turned on/off by hardware so there's no issue with the device
responding to a write-to-ROM in the same way as it responds to
a read-from-ROM. Delete the /WR connection and reclaim the GPIO
on the Pico.


It needs access to the Z80's /RESET line. It's a pain having to
use the switch on the Spectrum for something that the board can
do itself. This is also needed to start at address 0 when a new
ROM gets switched in. Pico needs a GPIO set to output which it
can use to bring the Z80's /RESET line low. I can use the GPIO
freed by the now unneeded /WR connection.


It needs a user input button. Writing to the ROM to reboot doesn't
seem practical. Pressing the button can advance to the next ROM in
the build. I think a brief press will select the next ROM and reset
the Z80, a long press can reboot the Pico itself.


In order for the Interface One ROM to page at the correct time I
need the Z80's /M1 signal. It's sort of a side point for the
purpose of this device, but will be useful for testing as I start
the IF1 project. I have a spare level shift and GPIO on the Pico.


I need +5V and 3V3 test points.


v1.1
====

The footprint for the right angle 6x6mm switch is wrong.
Button_Switch_THT:SW_Tactile_SKHH_Angled looks like a better option.
Fixed for v1.2.


The NPN2222 SMD transistor has a different pinout to the TTH hole I
used for prototyping. I created a new symbol with correct footprint
for v1.2.


The Pico receives a signal called ROM_ACCESS_INV, which is A14, A15
and /MREQ ORed together. Unfortunately that logic allows memory
refreshes through - see the Instruction Fetch section of the Z80
manual. This made sense when the Pico had the /RD signal, but since
that's now gone the Pico can't tell a read, write or refresh.
That's bad for the Interface One paging mechanism which
must only page with a memory read; a memory refresh of 0x0008 happens
at Z80 startup. The solution appears to be to put the ROM_READ_INV
signal through the level shifter and into the Pico instead of
ROM_ACCESS_INV, but I haven't done it yet. Needs thinking through.
For the IF1-demo use case /M1 can be used instead. /M1 goes high
for the refresh part of the read so the Pico can see the page
isn't required at that point. But see next point.


The 1.1 boards were fabricated with the Pico's GP15 not connected to
anything. It was /WR, which I disconnected. I intended to connect
/M1 but didn't actually do so. If this board is to run the IF1 ROM
switching reliably the /M1 signal will have to be put through the
level shifter and into the Pico. PCB has been updated with this
change for v1.2.
