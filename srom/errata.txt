The footprint for the SN74LVC245ANSR is wrong. The data sheet says 

SOIC (20) 12.80 mm × 7.50 mm

so I used the SOIC-20W_7.5x12.8mm_P1.27mm one. But there's a
discrepancy; the footprint is 7.5mm across the body of the device,
the datasheet says that distance is across the pins. The body of
the device is 5.00mm to 5.6mm according to the datasheet (which
it is). There isn't a non-wide version of that footprint in the
KiCAD libs. The one to use appears to be the SO-20_5.3x12.6mm_P1.27mm
one.


The footprint for the Pico's schottky diode is wrong. I copied AM's
circuit where he's used a SOD323 footprint. The diodes I bought are
3216 sized, and so too big. Increase footprint size.


I don't need the /WR line at the Pico. The level shifter for the
data bus is permanently in the Pico->ZX direction, so I can't
pick up a written value from the data bus. That level shifter is
turned on/off by hardware so there's no issue with the device
responding to a write-to-ROM in the same way as it responds to
a read-from-ROM. Delete the /WR connection and reclaim the GPIO
on the Pico.


It needs access to the Z80's /RESET line. It's a pain having to
use the switch on the Spectrum for something that the board can
do itself. This is also needed to start at address 0 when a new
ROM gets switched in. Pico needs a GPIO set to output which it
can use to bring the Z80's /RESET line low. I can use the GPIO
freed by the now unneeded /WR connection.


It needs a reset button input. Writing to the ROM to reboot doesn't
seem practical. It needs a button. I think a brief press will reset
the Z80 (parallel to the MOSFET); a long press can reboot the Pico
itself.


I needs a second button to change ROMs (then reset the Z80). I can
blink the Pico LED to indicate the ROM slot in use. I have one
spare GPIO, it can be used for this.
